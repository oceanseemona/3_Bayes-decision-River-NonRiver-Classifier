
Assignment-3 : Practical Implementation on Baye’s Decision Rule

OBJECTIVE:

• To classify all the test sample either in River or Non-River class 
(denoted by 0 and 255 at corresponding pixel locations) by applying Baye’s decision rule.

• To show the result in black and white image (0 and 255) form.

DATASET :

• Four satellite images of Kolkata (Rband, Gband, Bband and Iband) are given with equal 
image size (512 * 512). Those images are attached in the zip file with names band1, band2, band3 and band4.
• The feature vector dimension is 4.
• For each pixel location we have four values.
• Two classes are given (River and Non-River).

INSTALL:

This project requires Python 3.6 and the following Python libraries installed :-

>NumPy
command prompt: pip install numpy

>Pandas
command prompt: pip install pandas

>Sklearn
command prompt: pip install sklearn

>Matplotlib
command prompt: pip install matplotlib

>Jupyter Notebook
command prompt: pip install jupyter

If Python is not installed yet, Anaconda distribution of Python can also be used, which already has the above packages.

OUTPUT:

Three ouput images are shown for three cases:
Case 1 : River class (Prior Prob: ) = 0.3 , Nonriver class(Prior Prob) = 0.7
Case 2 : River class (Prior Prob: ) = 0.7 , Nonriver class(Prior Prob) = 0.3
Case 3 : River class (Prior Prob: ) = 0.5 , Nonriver class(Prior Prob) = 0.5
